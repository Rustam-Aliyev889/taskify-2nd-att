The app is aiming to help a team to manage their tasks and meetings. I wanted to find a solution for a teams to collaborate more effectively and achieve better results.

# Technologies and libraries used 
-   [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
-   [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
-   [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
-   [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework))
-   [Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework))
-   [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) - I decided to use RDBMS for this project as its:
-   RDBMS is based on rows and columns (table). So it is easier to understand RDBMS work.
-   RDBMS supports more than one user.
-   As it is advanced it can easily handle huge amounts of data.
-   Security is pretty good for RDBMS.




## Responsive Design Features 
-   The App has been made to be responsive on varying sized screens.
-   The App will resize from the screen of a mobile phone all the way to a full desktop display.
-   Its intended use is for more convinient usage of the service.
-   Even though the intended use is as stated it can still be used on a mobile by a therapist if required.
-   The treatment advice and notes are immediately available to the client after their session.
